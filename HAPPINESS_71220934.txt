I'll be the one that stays 'til the end 
And I'll be the one that needs you again 
And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses 
And truly loves you long after our curtain closes 
But will you still love me when nobody wants me around?
When I turn 81 and forget things 
Will you still be proud?
